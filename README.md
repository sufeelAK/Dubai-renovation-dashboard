# Dubai-renovation-dashboard
📌 Project Overview: High-Return Renovation Opportunities — Dubai Real Estate I analyzed Dubai property data to find places where renovating gives high returns. I made a Power BI dashboard that shows ROI by area, old vs renovated price per sq ft, and property type insights. This helps investors pick the best places to renovate.
🎯 Business Questions

Which areas give the highest ROI after renovation?

How do old price and renovated price compare per sq ft for each area?

Which property type (Villa vs Office) gives better average ROI?

Which communities have the lowest renovation cost but high ROI?

What is the average renovation cost by area?

How many properties of each type are in each area?

Which top 3 areas should an investor focus on for best returns?

🧩 Problem Statements Solved

ROI by community and property type.

Old vs renovated price per sq ft comparison.

Average renovation cost and % ROI.

Count of properties by area and type.

Top areas to invest for renovation.

🧠 Objective
Help investors and renovators find Dubai neighborhoods where small or medium renovations give high returns. Show clear charts so users can decide fast.

🔍 Project Process

Cleaned the data (prices, cost, types).

Calculated ROI and averages.

Built final Power BI dashboard and exported image.

🧩 Key Insights (example)

Some areas (e.g., Business Bay, Sheikh Zayed Road) show high renovated price and good ROI.

Villas vs Offices split the ROI — one type may give more return.

Low renovation cost areas can still give high % ROI.


Old price vs renovated price gap shows where value is added most.

✅ Conclusion
